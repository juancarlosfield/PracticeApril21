Create an octopus repository, and add an octopus.md file that contains the name and age of your octopus. From here, make sure to do all of your work on feature branches. (It's generally considered best practice to stay off the master branch while working, to avoid breaking your codebase. )
Add a cowboy hat feature by using the proper Git workflow. The feature itself can just be additional information in the octopus.md file, noting that the octopus is wearing a cowboy hat.
Merge your feature into your master branch.
Add a heart-shaped glasses feature using the same proper Git workflow.
Submit this assignment by uploading the relevant portion of your terminal history (as a screenshot or text file) and a zipped copy of your repo. Thank you for doing your part to make octopi more fashionable!
